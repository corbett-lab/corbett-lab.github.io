# Our Art

#### A one-act reminder email play:

You (wondering aloud): How can I see awesome research talks from amazing, diverse and accomplished UC postdocs this Monday and Tuesday mornings, and also make Russ proud?

Me (Russ, beaming): You can attend this totally sweet Baskin President's and Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship Symposium from 9-11 using these zoom links for Monday and Tuesday mornings. 

You (delighted): That's amazing! Can I also ask the speakers about their research in a smaller group, hear about their career paths, and get free delicious food via gift cards from the Division?

Me (triumphantly): Word. Sign up to meet with speakers in small groups using this convenient form. 

You (mind blown): Thanks, Russ! That is so fetch. 

Me (judgmentally): Stop trying to make 'fetch' happen, it's NOT going to happen!

Fin. 

This play was brought to you by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Please go to the symposium.
