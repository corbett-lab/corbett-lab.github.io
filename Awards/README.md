# Lab Awards
It is Corbett-Detig lab policy (as of ~2019) that any academic award that comes with a cash prize must be spent in part on a commemorative lava lamp. These are our lamps: 

- [Lavus parvusbryanii](/People/Lava_Lamp/Lavus_parvusbryanii/)
- [2](/People/Lava_Lamp/2/)
- [Lavus rastafarii](/People/Lava_Lamp/3/)
- [4](/People/Lava_Lamp/4/)
- [5](/People/Lava_Lamp/5/)
