* QUIZ RESULTS
* 
* Format:
*   Comments are begun with a *
*   
*   Results are on lines that begin with #
*   Following each result there are six indented lines
*   each containing a floating point number in the range [0,1]
*   The six numbers corrospond to
*       Compression
*       Readability
*       Code
*       Data
*       Goodness
*       Age
*   respectfully.
*   The range [0,1] maps to the minimum to maximum range of possible
*   values for that attribute, so, for example, in taking the test,
*   The compression attribute may range from -12 to 10. So a 1 in the first
*   indented line corrosponds to 10.
*   
*   Thus, each result is a point in 6D attribute space, and the actual result
*   that someone recieves is the nearest result point to their attribute scores.
*   Where nearest is judged by a Euclidean metric (I may do taxicab metric, idk)
