## Cluster Tracker is live! (10/1/2021)
We sent [cluster tracker](https://clustertracker.gi.ucsc.edu) into the world today! Cluster tracker is a tool for exploring the geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the US. Our [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/RussCorbett/status/1443983255040978949) explains the tool and provides information about its usage.
