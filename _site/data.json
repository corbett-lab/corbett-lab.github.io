The paper has just been published in PLoS Genetics, and the code can be acquired here. \nThis program can now estimate the timing of multiple admixture pulses. To find out more about modelling and fitting multiple pulses, read our paper in Genetics and visit our github.

We also maintain a repository of MAT files constructed from all publically available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which can be found <a href=\"http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/\">here</a>. Much of this software was developed by <a href=\"https://corbett-lab.github.io/People/Alumni/yatish/\">Yatish Turakhia</a> during his postdoc with Russ.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UShER</strong> itself is a program that rapidly places new samples onto an existing phylogeny using maximum parsimony. It is particularly helpful in understanding the relationships of newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes with each other and with previously sequenced genomes in a global phylogeny. This has emerged as an important challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic for enabling genomic contact tracing since the viral phylogeny is already very large (&gt;3.5M sequences) and is expected to grow by many fold in the coming months. UShER is much faster than existing tools with similar functionality and has now also been integrated in the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser.</p>\n\n<p><strong>matUtils</strong> is a toolkit for querying, interpreting and manipulating the mutation-annotated trees (MATs). Using matUtils, common operations in SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and contact tracing efforts, including annotating a MAT with new clades, extracting subtrees of the most closely-related samples, or converting the MAT to standard Newick or VCF format can be performed in a matter of seconds to minutes even on a laptop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>matOptimize</strong> is a program to rapidly and effectively optimize a mutation-annotated tree (MAT) for parsimony using subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) moves within a user-defined radius.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RIPPLES</strong> is a program that uses a phylogenomic technique to rapidly and sensitively detect recombinant nodes and their ancestors in a mutation-annotated tree (MAT).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/amkram/shusher\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ShUShER</strong></a> is a browser tool for the use of UShER on private data.
