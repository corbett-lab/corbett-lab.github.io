* 
* QUIZ RESULTS
* 
* Format:
*   Comments are begun with a *
*   
*   Results are on lines that begin with #
*   Following each result there are six indented lines
*   each containing a floating point number in the range [0,1]
*   The six numbers corrospond to
*       Compression
*       Readability
*       Code
*       Data
*       Goodness
*       Age
*   respectfully.
*   The range [0,1] maps to the minimum to maximum range of possible
*   values for that attribute, so, for example, in taking the test,
*   The compression attribute may range from -12 to 10. So a 1 in the first
*   indented line corrosponds to 10.
*   
*   Thus, each result is a point in 6D attribute space, and the actual result
*   that someone recieves is the nearest result point to their attribute scores.
*   Where nearest is judged by a Euclidean metric (I may do taxicab metric, idk)

%paf is a phylogenic ancestral file, invented by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. This was created to prevent tangles and knots in the family tree. Evidently, this has been successful, as the consanguinity coefficient among Utah mormons is 0.000106, while the average within-groups random kinship coefficient is 0.000312. Great Job!
