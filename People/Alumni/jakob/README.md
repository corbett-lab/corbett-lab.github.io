I'm particularly interested in nuclear spatial organization, large-scale phylogenetics, and somatic mosaicism. 

Recently I've been developing tools for contact tracing and understanding the flow of the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus across the United States, which can be found [here](https://github.com/yatisht/usher). You can play with the alpha version of my website for the tracking of new introductions of the virus across state borders in the USA [here](https://jmcbroome.github.io/introduction-website/).
